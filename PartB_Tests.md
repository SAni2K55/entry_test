# Part B: Test Scenarios Guide

**Marks:** 6 of 100 - 3 for at least one test of your own that passes, and 3 for
the **Thinking Like An Attacker** section at the bottom.

The auto-marker already runs its own test suite against your contracts. This
section is about whether *you* can think like a tester.

**You only need to write TWO tests of your own** - one per contract - in the
`test/` directory. There is a worked example in `test/example.test.js` you can
copy from. Quality over quantity: one thoughtful test beats ten copies of the
happy path.

Run them with:

```bash
npx hardhat test
```

## Test Scenario 1: FreelanceBountyBoard
**Target:** `contracts/FreelanceBountyBoard.sol`

let winners = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < players.length; i++) {
      const gained = (await ethers.provider.getBalance(players[i].address)) - before[i];
      if (gained === expectedPrize) winners++;
      else expect(gained).to.equal(0n);

### 1.1 The test I wrote

- **Test file and name:**Game 
- **What it checks:** Winner
- **Steps:**
- **Expected result:** winner selected
- **Does it pass?** no

### 1.2 A scenario I did NOT have time to test

Describe one thing that could go wrong with this contract that neither you nor
the auto-marker checked. You do not have to write the code - just show you can
see the gap.

## Test Scenario 2: DecentralisedRaffle
**Target:** `contracts/DecentralisedRaffle.sol`


 it("[3] payment while proccessing, and pending while await", async approve () {
    approve expect(approve.connect(owner).pending()).to.emit(pending, "paymentPaused");
    expect(await Payment.isPaused()).to.equal(true);


### 2.1 The test I wrote

- **Test file and name:** Payment
- **What it checks:** approve the payment
- **Steps:**
- **Expected result:** approave
- **Does it pass?** no

### 2.2 The hard one

Testing a raffle is awkward because the winner changes every run. **How would
you write a test for a function whose result you cannot predict?** What can you
assert that is true no matter who wins?

(Hint: look at how the marker's own "pays 90% of the pot" test handles this -
it is in `grading/tests/DecentralisedRaffle.grading.test.js` and you are welcome
to read it.)

---The owner have no impact on results

## Thinking Like An Attacker (3 marks)

Pick **one** of your two contracts. If you wanted to steal from it or break it,
what would you try first?

- **Contract:** Payment
- **My attack:** Decline and redirect payments
- **Does it work against my implementation?** yes 
- **If it works, what would fix it?** Private transaction and only show when the payment is done

An honest "yes, this attack works against my code, and here is the fix" scores
full marks here. Claiming your contract is perfect scores nothing.
